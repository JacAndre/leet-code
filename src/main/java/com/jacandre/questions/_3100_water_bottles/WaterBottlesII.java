/**
 * You are given two integers numBottles and numExchange.
 * numBottles represents the number of full water bottles that you initially have.
 * In one operation, you can perform one of the following operations:
 * Drink any number of full water bottles turning them into empty bottles.
 * Exchange numExchange empty bottles with one full water bottle. Then, increase numExchange by one.
 * Note that you cannot exchange multiple batches of empty bottles for the same value of numExchange.
 * For example, if numBottles == 3 and numExchange == 1, you cannot exchange 3 empty water bottles for 3 full bottles.
 * Return the maximum number of water bottles you can drink.
